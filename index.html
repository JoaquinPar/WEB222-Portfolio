                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Joaquin Paredes. I am from Chile. I have been living in Canada for more than 4 years now.
                        I always wanted to learn how to code, and when the opportunity finally came to me in high school, I took it.
                        I first learned Java in my last two years of high school, and when I got to college, I started learning linux,
                        c, c++, html, css, javascript and database. I hope to be able to build my career in the game development
                        industry, and create some amazing games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
